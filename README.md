### 📊 Understanding BMI Categories
BMI is a numerical measure of a person's body weight relative to their height. Here’s what the BMI values indicate:

| **BMI Range**    | **Category**       | **Health Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **< 18.5**       | Underweight        | May indicate malnutrition, undernourishment, or other health issues.                 |
| **18.5 - 24.9**  | Normal weight      | Indicates a healthy weight range and is considered optimal for good health. ✅        |
| **25.0 - 29.9**  | Overweight         | May lead to health risks like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.                  |
| **≥ 30.0**       | Obese              | Associated with a higher risk of chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes. |

A BMI in the range of **18.5 - 24.9** is considered **good health**, indicating a healthy weight for your height.
